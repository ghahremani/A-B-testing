# AB-testing
For this project, I ran an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. My goal is to to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. In the final part, I verify that the result I achieved in the A/B test can also be achieved by logistic regression.
